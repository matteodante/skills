# Replace With Skill Name

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- the user asks for the recurring task directly
- the repository or workflow clearly matches this skill

Do not use it when:

- the task is unrelated
- the work needs a different specialist skill

## Workflow

1. Gather the smallest useful context.
2. Identify the exact scope.
3. Make the change or produce the requested artifact.
4. Validate the result with the fastest reliable check.
5. Summarize what changed and what remains.

## Safety

- Do not expose secrets.
- Do not rewrite unrelated files.
- Prefer local project conventions over inventing new ones.

## Output

Return a concise final answer with:

- changed files or produced artifact
- validation performed
- any remaining risk or manual step
